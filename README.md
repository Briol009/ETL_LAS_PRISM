# ETL Pipelines for LAS Files and PRISM Data

This lab project focused on three subsections surrounding themes of geospatial analysis and visualization techniques. The first section of this lab is focused on using Lidar data from the Minnesota DNR using an ETL pipeline to convert a LIDAR file to a Triangulated Irregular Network and Digital Elevation Model dataset into a PDF format. The second section of this lab takes the Minnesota DNR elevation data and displays said data in both a 2-D and 3-D dataframe. The purpose of these two sections is to really understand different visualization methods using Jupyter Notebooks and ArcGIS Pro. The third section focuses on spatiotemporal data, demonstrated by an ETL pipeline that obtains the annual 30-Year Normals precipitation data from PRISM and is converted into a spacetime cube and exported as an animated time series.
